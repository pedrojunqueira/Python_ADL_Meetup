# My 12 months with Python

## how to go from vlookup analyst to data scientist


### Intro

Thanks all for connecting to this and to Python Adelaide for Leigh and Blake that gave the opportunity to talk.

This talk is not a technical talk but more of an inspirational talk and would probably cater more for beginners than experienced programers it is going to be more of a story telling about my progress and learning about Python and programming in general.

I new about the existence of a programming language called Python around 2015 when I also heard of something called data science, however it has been in around March 2019, i.e. last year that I took Python seriously and now I use Python at my job everyday so Python is one of the main reasons I get paid today.

Here is the message I wanted to give you on those 6 points that I will go more into detail throughout my talk.

### My Coding Career

Timeline major milestones

* 1985-89 BASIC/DOS
* 1990-1999 Windows
* 2000-2006 Excel/ppt
* 2006-2008 BI/Excel/Access
* 2008-2015 Trading Systems
* 2016-2018 SQL/DAX/Azure
* 2019 Python

Around early to mid 80 was my first contact with computers and programing I really put pressure on my parents to buy a computer. Ny father then enrolled me in programming classes. I was maybe around 9-10 years old. I did a bit of BASIC and the first real program I can remember of was a basic calculator. Yes they taught calculator back in those days.Probably the coolest and more challenging was a clock with handle and tick and got me a hocked in solving this problem. IN addition to that I also bought some magazines where I would copy the code and run the programs.

Did this for a few years. Maybe couple of years, then I got distracted with other things like video games. Atari was before I had the computer but then came Nintendo and other stuff like BMX and playing outside also I did not see much application and motivation to continue to learn and what really put a nail in the coffin was when the graphical interface was introduced with Windows. In Brazil, where I am from, maybe that would have been late 80s early 90s when Windows came and we did not need to use MS-DOS and the command line anymore. 

Now everything was point and click, drag and drop.

Someone had to do the coding but certainly that was not me.

Mid 90s I finished High School I was in doubt in 3 university courses

1. Business
2. Economics
3. Computer Science

I could have chosen either but end up going the practical way. With hindsight I would probably should have chosen CS as you will see when I tell my coding career story.

There were zero programming in a Business Curriculum and the "computing classes" were Excel spreadsheets mainly for running financial models and also there was a Database class where we learned Access and that was it. All the rest that had any technology was more from a theoretical and managerial point not on the technical get your hands dirty.

For most of my adult carer I was a heavy excel user and had the annoying title as the excel wizard but what I really knew well was pivot tables and vlookup function.

The transition to IT and data happened gradually. As a Financial Analyst and Business Analyst I always dealt with data and eventually excel became limited for some number crunching I used to do. in 2007 excel had only 65,000 rows and I had some economic models with a million rows and the solution was to do it in access and output the data using a pivot table with a ODBC connection to the Access Database. Also used BI systems like Cognos Power Play, TM1 and even learned IBM AS400 query language to extract data from the ERP system. Regarding programing I did a bit of SQL and some limited excel VBA when required but it was 99% only excel functions.

In 2015 I started to hear the word Data Scientist when a friend from work pointed me to an article about this new profession called Data Science. My friend said this is you Pedro. I kind of identified myself but when I read the article it said about statistician and programming language which I was not. 

In this article there was a new professional association IAPA and they were offering a free membership.
 I went to the monthly meet up for around 3 - 4 times to do some networking and try to understand what this was all about. On the first talk I went to talk to the person presenting and asked if he could give me a starting kit to become a Data Scientist.

 He recommended a book called Elements of Statistical learning, take the free DataCamp Python and R course open a Kaggle and a Git Hub account and start coding. As simple as that.

 I when home excited and started the python course and it was really, really hard for me. I had a look in the ESL book and when I saw all those mathematical notation I had a foggy vision and it was like another language that it simply made no sense for me and after trying for about 3 to 4 weeks I simply gave up and though. Data Science is not for me and then I did nothing about it for about 1.5 year.

 In this time I was really bored about Business Analysis and decided that I wanted to be a financial planner.

 Then after failing as a Financial Planner got a contract as a Business Analysis and my second project was to do a Business Case for a BI business unit which in the end I was hired to be the unit manager then this is when I took off and had the drive to learn Data Analytics and Data Science.

 I used the just in time learning and started learning as I needed it.

 I learned SQL, DAX (Microsoft Data Modelling Language) Azure, Analysis Services, Data Factory and build a team and an end-to-end BI platform.

 Then it was then in 2018 I learned R and what really helped me was a Udemy course that thought Machine Learning from A-Z and kudos for Kirill Eremenco from SuperData Science that put this course.

 I was able to finally understand the maths and the code necessary to put data science into practice.

Developed my first data science workflow and predictive model and used to help convert sales in the company I was working for.

Until then I did not know Python at all then in February 2019 I made a commitment that I wanted to become a real data scientist and learn Python property and focus on the language I was going to learn the most.


Completed the Python Bootcamp in Udemy the Python Data Scientist path of Data Quest in about 2.5 months and since then I have been averaging 10-20 hours per week of studding data science and coding tools.

When I was confident
